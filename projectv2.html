    We can examine a rather interesting case between one's Openness and 
    their diversity amongst artists. Similarly to the case between 
    Conscientiousness and cohesion, one would think there would be a positive 
    correlation. If a listener is more open to new ideas, they would be open to 
    listening to more artists. However, we see that the opposite is true. 
    The more open a listener is, the less diverse their artists' portfolio is. 
    With this path of logic, one could then take a deeper look into the correlations 
    between Openness and cohesion, as well as Conscientiousness and diversity. 
    Perhaps if both have negative correlation, their converse is positive?
